The Ferron URL rewriting support plugin for WordPress enables support for URL rewriting in Ferron web server. This allows you to use URLs like "http://website.example/2025/03/29/sample-post/" instead of "http://website.example/index.php/2025/03/29/sample-post/".
WordPress (as of 6.7.2) supports URL rewriting only in Apache httpd, NGINX, Caddy, and IIS. This plugin enables support for URL rewriting in Ferron.
To install the plugin, clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/ferronweb/ferron-rewrite-support`), then pack the contents of the repository (except ".git" directory) to the ZIP archive (put the contents to the "ferron-rewrite-support" directory in the archive). After creating a ZIP archive, go to the WordPress administration dashboard, then "Plugins", then "Add New plugin", then "Upload Plugin", select the archive containing this plugin, and click "Install Now". After installation, activate the plugin to enable support for URL rewriting in Ferron web server.
